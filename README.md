Markie is an intelligent web application designed to bridge the gap between writing in Markdown and publishing professional, search-engine-friendly web content. It automates the tedious process of manual HTML conversion and optimization by leveraging the Google Gemini API to generate perfectly structured semantic HTML, meta tags, and structured data.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **ü§ñ AI-Powered Semantic HTML:** Goes beyond basic conversion by using AI to generate a fully semantic HTML structure (`<section>`, `<figure>`, etc.) that's optimized for accessibility and SEO.
- **üöÄ Automatic SEO Metadata:** Generates SEO-friendly titles and meta descriptions based on your article's content with a single click.
- **üìä Structured Data (JSON-LD):** Automatically creates JSON-LD schema for articles, helping your content stand out in search results with rich snippets.
- **üîê User-Provided API Keys:** Your Google Gemini API key is stored securely in your browser's local storage and is never sent to our servers, ensuring your privacy and data security.
- **üñ•Ô∏è Live Preview & Code Output:** Instantly preview your rendered article and access the generated code across multiple tabs: Full HTML, Article Body, Meta Tags, and Schema.
- **üåç Full Internationalization:**
  - **Bilingual Interface:** Supports both English and Arabic.
  - **RTL/LTR Layout:** The entire user interface automatically adjusts its directionality based on the selected language.
- **üåó Light & Dark Mode:** A sleek, modern interface that respects your system preference or can be toggled manually. All user preferences are saved in local storage.
